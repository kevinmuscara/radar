Server-Side Status Checking Architecture Overview Radar performs all status checks on the server at configurable intervals (default: 30 minutes). Results are stored in a SQLite database and served to clients instantly. Key Benefits: Zero client-side overhead : Clients fetch pre-computed status data Unlimited scalability : 1 user or 10,000 users = same server load Consistent data : All users see the same status at the same time No external API throttling : Services checked once per interval, not per user Instant dashboard loads : No waiting for status checks Efficient resource usage : Single check serves all users How It Works: Server checks all resources every N minutes (configurable) Status results stored in resource_status_cache database table Failed checks get one automatic retry Persistent failures logged to status_check_errors table Clients fetch cached statuses via /api/cached-statuses endpoint Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 minutes to show latest cached data Configurable Check Interval Default: 30 minutes Range: 1-60 minutes Configuration: Admin Dashboard \u2192 Dashboard Settings \u2192 Status Check Interval // Default in StatusChecker.js this.CHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes Choosing the Right Interval: 5-10 minutes : High-priority services, frequent updates needed 15-30 minutes : Balanced approach for most use cases (recommended) 30-60 minutes : Stable services, reduced server load priority Note: Interval can be changed without restarting the server. The StatusChecker automatically applies the new interval. Smart Retry Logic Automatic Retries: Failed status checks tracked during initial scan One retry attempt for each failure after all resources checked Only persistent failures (both attempts fail) logged as errors Prevents false alarms from transient network issues Benefits: Reduces false error reports Batches retries to minimize server load Smart error logging only for real issues Progress Tracking Real-Time Progress Monitoring: The admin dashboard displays a progress bar during status checks: Shows current resource being checked Displays progress (e.g., \"15/20\") Progress updates every 500ms Visual indicator at bottom of navigation header Benefits: Administrators can see check status in real-time Know exactly when manual refresh completes Track which resources are taking longer to check Manual Refresh Rate Limiting Protection Against Abuse: Manual refresh button limited to once per minute Server enforces 60-second cooldown Prevents spam and unnecessary server load Client displays remaining cooldown time const FORCE_REFRESH_COOLDOWN = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute When Manual Refresh is Triggered: Cancels any in-progress check Waits for current check to stop (max 5 seconds) Starts fresh check immediately Prevents overlapping requests Database Caching Status Cache Table: CREATE TABLE resource_status_cache ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, resource_id INTEGER, resource_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, status TEXT NOT NULL, status_url TEXT, last_checked DATETIME NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); Benefits: Fast indexed lookups by resource name Unique constraint prevents duplicate entries Timestamp tracking for audit purposes Persistent across server restarts API Rate Limiting Endpoint Protection: Limit : 200 requests per minute per IP Applies to analyze-api and RSS feed endpoints Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes Returns 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 200; Protected Endpoints: /api/analyze-api - API structure analyzer /api/rss - RSS feed generation /api/force-refresh - Manual refresh (separate 60s limit) Performance Impact Scenario: Dashboard with 50 resources, 100 concurrent users Metric Old Client-Side New Server-Side Improvement Status check requests (per page load) 5,000 (50\u00d7100) 1 99.98% reduction External service API hits (per hour) 30,000+ 100 99.7% reduction Dashboard load time 5-30s (variable) <500ms Instant Server CPU during peak High, spiky Low, constant Predictable Scalability Limited by checks Unlimited Infinite Database writes (per hour) 0 100 Audit trail Real-World Impact: Before : 100 users \u00d7 50 resources = 5,000 simultaneous external requests After : 1 scheduled check \u00d7 50 resources = 50 sequential requests Result : 100\u00d7 reduction in external API load, eliminated rate limiting Configuration Adjust Check Interval: Admin Dashboard \u2192 Dashboard Settings \u2192 Status Check Interval (1-60 minutes) Or edit config/SetupManager.js : await this.#setSetting(\"refresh_interval_minutes\", \"30\"); // Change 30 to desired Adjust Client Refresh Rate: Edit public/script.js : const AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes (milliseconds) Adjust Force Refresh Cooldown: Edit routes/api.js : const FORCE_REFRESH_COOLDOWN = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute Adjust API Rate Limit: Edit routes/api.js : const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 200; // Requests per IP Monitoring Server Logs: [StatusChecker] Started (30 min interval) [StatusChecker] Starting status check...

Once you have finished installing Radar on your server, you can begin setting up your dashboard by going to the host and port you have configured for your Radar environment. You will be presented with the setup wizard shown below. In this wizard, you can customize the following settings: - Admin account username - Admin account password - Dashboard/School name - Dashboard Branding/logo - Status Check Interval When you are finished customizing these settings, hit the blue Complete Setup button to continue. Creating your first category After you have completed the setup wizard, you will be brought to the admin dashboard. From here you can modify the settings you chose in the initial setup, such as changing the admin username/password, changing the branding logo, etc. In the categories table to the right, click the + icon to create your first category. NOTE: You must create a category first before you can create resources In the popup modal pictured below, enter the name for your category and click the green Add button. You should now see your category listed in the table. Creating your first resource After creating your first category, you can add your first resource. In the resources table just below the categories table, click the + icon to create your first resource. In the popup modal pictured below, fill out the form. For more information about the types of checks, see the table below: API (JSON) : Use this if your resource link will be a JSON based status page. Web Scrape (keywords) : Use this if your resource will need to scrape a specific keyword off of the linked page. (Example: searching for the phrase \"operational\" on a page). Heartbeat (HTTP 200) : Use this if your resource will simply have a heartbeat monitor of the linked page. API Scraping Follow these steps to browse an API for a specific field for your resource status: Type the API URL into the Status Page URL field on the add resource modal. Select the blue Analyze button and the API Structure Explorer will show as pictured below: You can use the search fields to search for a specific key or value in the structured API. Once you found the field for the object related to your reseource, select the field that contains the current status of the resource. Once you have selected the associated field, you can now create the resource. NOTE: If using the Web Scrape (keywords) check type, be sure to include a keyword that you want to filter by. You will now see your category listed in the table. If you want to add a resource to more than one category, be sure to select multiple categories in the checkbox selection. Bulk importing categories To bulk import multiple categories, you may begin by downloading the template csv file linked under the Bulk Import section. Once you have downloaded the template, add your resources following the header structure. If you need further assistance with adding resources, please refer to This Guide Once you have completed your CSV import, you will see all of the categories and resources in their respective tables.
